## Implementation Verification

### HTTP Method Coverage

| Method | Implemented | JSON Variant | Retry |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| GET | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| POST | Yes | Yes | No |
| PUT | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| DELETE | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| HEAD | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| PATCH | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### Feature Coverage

| Class | Documented | Implemented | Coverage |
|-------|------------|-------------|----------|
| SIMPLE_HTTP | 50 | 50 | 100% |
| SIMPLE_HTTP_RESPONSE | 25 | 25 | 100% |
| SIMPLE_HTTP_REQUEST_BUILDER | 20 | 20 | 100% |
| SIMPLE_HTTP_RETRY_POLICY | 10 | 10 | 100% |
| SIMPLE_HTTP_INTERCEPTOR | 3 | 3 | 100% |
| SIMPLE_HTTP_COOKIE_JAR | 6 | 6 | 100% |

### Authentication Verification

| Auth Type | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Bearer | Authorization: Bearer {token} |
| Basic | Authorization: Basic {base64(user:pass)} |
| API Key | {header_name}: {key} |
| Custom | Authorization: {value} |

### Response Status Verification

| Status Range | Query | Implementation |
|--------------|-------|----------------|
| 200-299 | is_success | Status 200-299 |
| 300-399 | is_redirect | Status 300-399 |
| 400-499 | is_client_error | Status 400-499 |
| 500-599 | is_server_error | Status 500-599 |
| Error | has_error | error_occurred |

### Retry Policy Verification

| Config | Default Value |
|--------|---------------|
| max_retries | 3 |
| initial_delay_ms | 100 |
| max_delay_ms | 30000 |
| exponential | True |

## Specification Gaps

### Identified Gaps
1. **No file upload** - multipart/form-data not supported
2. **No HTTP/2** - ISE library limitation
3. **No streaming** - Large responses loaded into memory
4. **Basic cookie jar** - No domain/path/expiry

### Research vs Implementation Delta
The research document identified these requirements:
- Basic HTTP methods: IMPLEMENTED
- JSON support: IMPLEMENTED
- Retry support: IMPLEMENTED
- Redirect support: IMPLEMENTED
- Cookie support: IMPLEMENTED (basic)
- Interceptors: IMPLEMENTED
- File upload: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Streaming: NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Caching: NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Recommended Additions
1. Multipart form data for file uploads
2. Streaming response body
3. HTTP caching (ETag, If-Modified-Since)
4. Proxy configuration
5. Connection pool management

## Backwash Notes

This specification was reverse-engineered from the implementation. The following assumptions were made:

1. Retry logic inferred from code structure
2. ISE library behavior assumed for redirects
3. JSON integration via simple_json ecosystem
4. Base64 encoding via simple_base64 ecosystem

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Source code matches S04 feature list
- [x] Contracts in S03 match require/ensure clauses
- [x] HTTP methods all documented
- [x] Retry policy correctly documented
- [x] Cookie jar correctly documented
- [x] Interceptor interface correctly documented

## Certification

This specification accurately represents the simple_http library implementation as of 2026-01-23.

**Specification Status:** VALIDATED
**Implementation Status:** COMPLETE (Phase 2)
**Test Coverage:** PARTIAL
**Ecosystem Integration:**
- simple_json: INTEGRATED
- simple_base64: INTEGRATED
- simple_encoding: INTEGRATED
